            <h1>Spyros Anagnostopoulos</h1>

           
            <p>Born in Thessaloniki and moved to Xanthi from early age, where I spent my childhood life.
            As a child and a teenager I spent many years playing sports and attended piano classes for 9 years. Generally average student but better in classes that I liked.
            Since 2013 I reside in Volos to pursue an Electrical & Computer Engineering degree at the University of Thessaly.
            It took me some time to find my calling and in the first two years I wasn't attending classes, but then I found that there are specific fields within my department that interest me.
            Now, I am in the 7th year and hopefully by the end of summer I will have my degree.</p>
